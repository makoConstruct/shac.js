##Autocompletion
Autocompletion gives an input sublime-like autocompletion behavior with a single function call. It's as simple as
```
attachAutocompletion(element, completionCandidateArray, selectionEventCallback);
```
The [completion scheme](https://github.com/makoConstruct/CleverMatcher) used is a friend to programmers, essentially providing a substring search with an  to initialisms.
