##Autocompletion
Autocompletion gives an input sublime-like autocompletion behavior with a single function call. It's as simple as
```
attachAutocompletion(inputElement, completionCandidate_array);
```
The [completion scheme](https://github.com/makoConstruct/CleverMatcher) used is a friend to programmers, essentially providing a substring search with an attraction to initialisms.

Oh, I guess I was lying when I said it was as simple as a single function call, styling the dropdown menu and its items is left to you, however a nice enough style is provided in the [demo](http://makopool.com/autocompleteDemo.html) html and you are welcome to copy it for yourself.
